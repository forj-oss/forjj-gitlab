# Introduction

This directory is maintained by BuildEnv (https://github.com/forj-oss/build-env)

When you need to update it (bugs/features), refresh it as follow:

1. load your build env with `build-env` or `source build-env.sh`
2. refresh it with `be_update`

This will update BuildEnv wrappers (bin/) and BuildEnv libs (lib/)
